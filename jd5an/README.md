# Data summary - John Dunne

When searching for an interesting and worthwhile data set I thought to myself, "What topic is relevant to humans and has likely touched the reader or someone known to the reader?" The answer is obvious...the big "C", cannibalism. We all know someone who has struggled with cannibalism and hopefully these insights related to some salt of the earth isopods from some hot springs in New Mexico deliver some solace to you, the reader.

## Overview of data
I used data from https://datadryad.org/bitstream/handle/10255/dryad.44873/dryad%20data%20sharing.xlsx?sequence=1 which contains the following columns, Individual, Population, Sex, Dorsal Length, Dorsal width, Ventral length, Ventral width, Unique Identifier, Partner, Partner sex, Body size (PC1), Relative BS, Trial #, Start of trial, end of trial, Latency, Attack, Gaurd, Latency-trans, Body Size Standardized, Partner BS Standardized.  The organisms used for this experiment are Socorro isopod (Thermosphaeroma thermophilum) which are freshwater isopods native to New Mexico.
